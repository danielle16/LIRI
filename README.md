##Functionality
Liri takes in 4 user commands including: 
my-tweets
spotify-this-song 'song title'
movie-this 'movie title'
do-what-it-says
and spits out different information about each. The first one retrievces the user's latest tweets and prints them to the terminal. The second one uses the Spotify API and returns data on the song the user inputs. The movie-this command grabs data from the OMDB API and returns specific data on the film entered by that user. The last command retrieves data from a file called random.txt and returns that which ever command or function is in that file.
