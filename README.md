##Functionality
Liri takes in 4 user commands including 
my-tweets
spotify-this-song 'song title'
movie-this 'movie title'
do-what-it-says
and spits out information about each. The first one retrievces that user's latest tweets. The second one uses the Spotify API and return data on the song the user inputs. The movie-this command grabs data from the OMDB API and returns specific data on the film entered by the user. The last command retrieves data from a file called random.txt and returns that text to the user.
